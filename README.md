# What is Azure Database Migration Service?

**Azure Database Migration Service** is a fully managed service designed to enable seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime (online migrations).

With Azure Database Migration Service currently we offer two options:

- Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio
- Database Migration Service (classic) - via Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI.

**Azure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio** is powered by the latest version of Database Migration Service and provides more features. Currently, it supports SQL Database modernization to Azure. For improved functionality and supportability, consider migrating to Azure SQL Database by using the Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio.

**Database Migration Service (classic)** via Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI is an older version of the Azure Database Migration Service. It offers database modernization to Azure and support scenarios like â€“ SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. 

# Data Migration Assistant

**The Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.
